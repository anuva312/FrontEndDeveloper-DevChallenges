## Challenge I : Button Component

Create a reusable button with all the states in the design and a page displaying all the states.

Fulfill user stories below:

- User story: I can see different button types: default, outline and text
- User story: I can choose to disable box-shadow
- User story: I can choose to disable the button
- User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)
- User story: I can have different button sizes
- User story: I can have different colors
- User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
- User story: I can still access all button attributes
- User story (optional): Show button in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the button in multiple states is enough
